## Project Description

Due to the fact that our team chose to recreate the well-established, classic terminal of trading, it would make sense to review the essential features that will make this Stock Terminal so useful to the users.
The main architectural style of our project is application based. We will be using an application to receive user input. 
Once inputted, our program will run Python code to scrape, collect, and perform analysis on the given company. 
The user will only be interacting with PyQt5. The application, however, will perform data analysis on the back-end to provide information.
By reviewing the overall trading system and the latest news in the market, we will be able to translate the key controls as well as put our own spin to the idea to add originality.

### Project Components

This section includes all major components and frameworks/libraries we will use.
* Front End - The front end consists of what the user sees and interacts with. Our front end will consist of the PyQt5 library in Python3. Therefore, Python will be the only main language used to complete the application.
* Back End - The back end will consist of a mix of Python3 libraries and modules like Matplotlib and Pendulum.
* User Interface - Web Page display for users
* [Python](https://www.python.org)
* [Python Pendulum Module](https://pypi.org/project/pendulum/)
* [PyQt Library](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
* [Matlibplot Library](https://matplotlib.org)
* [newspaper Library](https://pypi.org/project/newspaper/)
* [GoogleNews Library](https://pypi.org/project/GoogleNews/)
* [Textblob Library](https://pypi.org/project/textblob/0.9.0/)

## How are we doing it?

We are using Yahoo Finance to scrap our data for the stock terminal to provide us with the latest financial news, data and commentary including stock quotes, press releases, financial reports, and original content. 
In addition to posting partner content from other web sites, it posts original stories by its team of staff journalists.
The Python3 Library PyQt5 will be very useful in our code as it is a comprehensive set of Python bindings for Qt v5. 
It is implemented as more than 35 extension modules and enables Python to be used as an alternative application development language to C++ on all supported platforms including iOS and Android.
